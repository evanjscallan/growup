        "plantDescription": "A Persian Shield plant, sometimes called a Royal Purple plant, is a tropical, fast growing plant that loves high humidity and warm temperatures. It has dark green, iridescent leaves with metallic, light purple stripes. Originally from Myanmar (Burma) not Persia, it gets the name Persian Shield because the leaves resemble little, feudal battle shields. The pale purple flowers of a Persian Shield plant canâ€™t compare to the beautiful leaves. This plant can be planted outdoors, but does even better as a potted, indoor plant.",
        "plantType": "House Plant",
        "plantSunlightNeeds": "A Persian Shield plant needs bright indirect light to maintain the vibrant colors in its leaves; but no direct afternoon sun or the leaves may be damaged. The plant becomes thin and leggy when there is not enough light.",

        "plantDescription": "Potted bamboo palms bring color and warmth to any room in the house. There are many tropical delights to choose from, but most need bright indirect light in order to thrive. Bamboo palm (Chamaedorea seifrizii) is an exception to this rule and will grow in low light conditions, although they will grow taller with more light. Mature height varies from 4 to 12 feet (1 to 3.5 m.) with a span of 3 to 5 feet (91 cm. to 1.5 m.). The bamboo palm plant can also be planted outdoors in the USDA plant hardiness zones 10 and 11.
